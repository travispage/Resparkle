= Why use Facebook Pixel - Pixel Cat? =

There are multiple ways to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.

**1. Pasting your Facebook Pixel into your theme**
This approach isn't great for two reasons:
a) If you edit your live site and make a mistake when pasting your Facebook Pixel script into your theme, you could take down your website.
b) If your theme is updated with new features or security fixes, your Facebook Pixel code will be overwritten.

**2. Pasting the new Facebook Pixel script into a header/footer script plugin**
This is a valid approach, but has some disadvantages. General purposes "header script plugins" aren't built from the ground-up to support Facebook's Pixel. 

What this means is that :
a) These plugins lack Facebook-specific functionality. There's no easy way to add Standard Events, Custom Events or Dynamic Events.
b) These plugins will not adapt if Facebook changes their pixel again in the future. Since Pixel Cat is a dedicated Facebook Pixel plugin, we'll make sure make sure to stay compatible with future changes by Facebook.
c) These plugins usually don't support hiding your Facebook Pixel from logged-in users.

And, most importantly: with Pixel Cat you can set up Facebook Pixel standard events, without having to write a single line of code.

The bottom line is that Pixel Cat is the best way to add a Facebook Pixel to your WordPress site.
