		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>D) Configuration</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>This help section will walk you through each plugin settings option.</p> 

		<ol>
			<li><strong>Enable/Disable</strong> - Enabling the advanced review reminder will schedule emails to be sent to your clients once the order status is marked 'Completed'.  Disabling the plugin will ensure no emails are sent to your clients.</li>
			<li><strong>Day(s) after order</strong> - Enter number values representing the days after which the email will be sent.  You can enter as many values as you want seperated by commas and for each value an email will be sent X amount of days after the order was marked 'Completed'.<br/><i><u>NOTE:</u> Once a customer completes a review for a given product they will no longer be emailed to review that specific product, but will continue to receive emails for other products within the same order!</i></li>
			<li><strong>Email subject</strong> - The subject line your customer will receive for the review reminder email.</li>
			<li><strong>Email content</strong> - The content of the review reminder email.  Within the email subject and content you can use the following macros that can personalize the email to each of your customers: 
				<ol>
					<li>{customer_name}	- Replaced with the customers full name.</li>
					<li>{customer_firstname}	- Replaced with the customers first name.</li>
					<li>{customer_lastname}	- Replaced with the customers last name.</li>
					<li>{order_id}	- Replaced with the order id.</li>
					<li>{customer_email} - Replaced with the customer email.</li>

				</ol>

		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>E) Review Email</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>The review reminder email utilizes the configured WooCommerce email template by default.  See example below:</p>

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="debug"><strong>F) How the plugin works / debugging</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>


		<p>The plugin works by monitoring when an order has been marked as "complete". This is the trigger that assumes a product has been sent. For virtual products this happens immediately as there is no shipping involved.</p>

		<p>The plugin creates individual non-repeatable WordPress cronjobs. The date and time the emails are sent are defined from the plugin settings. </p>

		<p>In version 1.2 we created a debug log on the bottom of the plugin admin page to monitor the plugin activity. Here are the possible log entries:</p>
		<p><strong>NOTE: If you are upgrading the plugin version you MUST disable and then enable the plugin to create the necessary logging database tables first in order to view the logs.</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Order x marked as completed. Scheduled emails to be sent to (email) on following dates: (send dates)</strong> - This will be logged if an order status is changed to "Completed" from another status, and will schedule emails to be sent to the customer.</li>
			<li><strong>(Order x) E-mail sent to (email) - Day (days after order) reminder.</strong> - This will be logged once an email is sent to a customer for an order and the days after the order was marked "Competed".</li>
			<li><strong>Order x has changed status. Not completed, no e-mails scheduled.</strong> - This will be logged if an order status is changed from "Completed" to another status, so no emails will be sent to the customer.</li>
			<li><strong>(email) was added to the blocklist.</strong> - This will be logged if a customer asked to unsubscribe from the review reminder emails.</li>
		</ol>
		<img src="assets/images/reminder_logs.png" alt="log example" width="800"/>
		
		<p>To further debug and verify emails are scheduled and sent we recommend the following plugins:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Email Log - <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/email-log/">http://wordpress.org/plugins/email-log/</a> - Monitor ALL outgoing emails from your WordPress site.</li>
			<li>WP Crontrol - <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/">http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/</a> - See all scheduled cron jobs</li>
		</ul>

		<hr>

		<h3 id="manual"><strong>G) Manual Emails</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Under <strong>WooCommerce -> Orders</strong>, select an order and in the bottom right corner you will find a metabox called "Email Review Request".  If you click the button within the metabox an email will be sent requesting a review for the given order.<br/><u>Note</u>: Any scheduled emails will still be sent.<br/></p>
