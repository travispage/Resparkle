"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Simple Shortcode that shows just link and can be used "
"anywhere: <strong>[WOO_GENS_RAF]</strong><br/>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2. Advance Shortcode that comes with share links, like example "
"on <a href=\"%s\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>. To get that exact look, "
"just center text via editor. Shortcode is:<br/> "
"<strong>[WOO_GENS_RAF_ADVANCE guest_text=\"Text to show when user is not "

"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3. Shortcode for Contact Form 7 plugin is <strong>[gens_raf]</"
